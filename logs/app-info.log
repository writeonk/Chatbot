[INFO ] 2025-09-03 20:14:43.272 [main] ChatBotGenericTest - Question: Auto-scroll should work when multiple messages sent
[INFO ] 2025-09-03 20:14:43.273 [main] ChatBotGenericTest - Bot Response: Auto-scroll functionality in messaging or chat applications is typically designed to ensure that the latest message is visible to the user without manual scrolling. Here’s how auto-scroll generally works and what you should verify when testing this feature:
How Auto-Scroll Should Work When Multiple Messages Are Sent
Expected Behavior
Automatic Scrolling: When multiple new messages are received or sent (either by the user or by the system), the chat window should automatically scroll to display the most recent message at the bottom.
Batch Message Handling: If several messages arrive in quick succession (such as system notifications, bot responses, or user messages), the view should continue to auto-scroll so that the latest message is always visible.
User Interaction Exception: If the user manually scrolls up (to read previous messages), auto-scroll should pause to avoid disrupting the user’s reading. Auto-scroll typically resumes only after the user scrolls back to the bottom.
Testing Steps
Send Multiple Messages Quickly:
Observe whether the chat window scrolls down automatically after each message so the latest message is visible.
Simulate Receiving Multiple Messages:
If possible, have another user or a bot send several messages in a row. Confirm that the chat view remains at the newest message.
Scroll Up and Receive Messages:
Manually scroll up to older messages, then have new messages arrive. The window should not auto-scroll until the user returns to the bottom.
Return to Bottom:
Scroll back down and verify that auto-scroll resumes for new incoming messages.
Common Issues
Auto-scroll fails when multiple messages are received rapidly.
Auto-scroll interrupts user when reading older messages.
Auto-scroll only works for sent messages, not for received ones.
